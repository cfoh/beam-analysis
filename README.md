# Numerical Computation and Simulation

## Numerical Computation

It contains the numerical computation of our submitted paper:
- A. Kose, H. Lee, C. H. Foh, "Context Learning Multi-Armed Bandit for Interference-Aware Beam Allocation in mmWave Vehicular Communications," Submitted to IEEE Transactions on XXXX.

The numerical computation is written in Python. The instructions to run the program and the required packages are given in the source code.

## Simulation

The simulation is developed using our own Python Mobility Simulation Platform (PyMoSim). We plan to release the source code of PyMoSim in the near future. PyMoSim documentation is available for public viewing [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/cfoh/pymosim-doc/blob/master/index.html).
